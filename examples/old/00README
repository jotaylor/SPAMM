Refer to Wiki "How to SPAMM" on how to run simple modeling with SPAMM

# analyze_model_run.py  simple analysis of modeling results (pickle of the object "model"): 
                        plots chains, posteriors, computes percentiles-means et al.
# model.pickle.gz       example of modeling output (pickled object "model")
# old                   trash bin - contains old codes not in use any longer
# plots                 contains all the outputs (plots) of analyze_model_run.py
# read_model_run.py     reads pickle of the object "model"
# simple_run_general.py reads data, implements components, runs mcmc modeling, outputs pickle of the object "model"
# triangle.py           code to build triangle plot
