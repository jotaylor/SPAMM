**********
This directory contains fake powerlaw component only spectra.  The Excel
spreadsheet in ../fakedata_properties.xlsx shows all the properties of
these spectra.

Importantly, the "final" spectra to actually be used (i.e., 3-column
wavelength, flux, error) are the fakepowlaw*_werr.dat spectra.  A quick
look plot of these 6 spectra and error spectra are in finpowlaws_werr.eps. 

Everything else in this directory was used to make these spectra:

*Orig_NondegSpec/ subdirectory contains the original spectra with no
noise added.  They were created with mkpowlaws.sm. 

*adderrspec.sm - creates and adds error spectrum to fake data in
fakepowlaw*_deg.dat to make fakepowlaw*_werr.dat.

*fakepowlaw*_deg.dat - S/N degraded versions of
Orig_NondegSpec/fakepowlaw#.dat.  I used my program snr_deg.f to add
Gaussian noise to degrade the S/N. The Excel spreadsheet
../fakedata_properties.xlsx gives the S/N of each spectrum and the
wavelength range the original S/N was measured in to use as a basis for
degrading it.

*fakepowlaw*_werr.dat - These are the final spectra to be used to fit
with SPAMM.  The first 2 columns are the same as fakepowlaw*_deg.dat,
but they now have an error spectrum in the third column added with
adderrspec.sm.  This process is the same as I used for the fake emission line
spectra, and so is described in the 00README_errspec_create
readme file .  Final spectra and
error spectra can been visualized in finspec_wnoiserr.eps. 

*fracerrspec_dsp*.dat(.fits) - SDSS fractional error spectrum that has
been converted to the different linear dispersion scales of the 6 fake
data wavelength arrays.  The ascii versions of these were read into
adderrspec.sm and used to make the fake error spectra added to each fake
data spectrum.  See 00README_errspec_create in the ../EmissionLineComp/
directory for more details.

*mkpowlaws.sm - SM macro that actually makes the initial "no-noise" powerlaw
spectra that I later copied to Orig_NondegSpec/
