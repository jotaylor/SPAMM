* Marianne (everything)
* Gisella (everything but host galaxy)
* Roberto (host galaxy)
* Kelly (emission lines)
* Matthias (Balmer continuum)
* Kevin (host galaxy?)
* Demitri (host galaxy and stellar pops)
* ??? (reddening law)

2) Write spectral components --> needs people who can code - Sep 30, 2013

* Roberto
* Demitri
* Anna

3) Generate test data (S/N, blind data, etc.) - Aug 30, 2013

Tests that need to be done:

1) Simulated Data: test S/N, resolution, wavelength coverage, components
2) Real Data: test S/N, resolution, wavelength coverage, components (lines)
